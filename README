An attempt to port Play! framework YABE tutorial from JPA to Siena and run it on Google app engine.

Mainly the JPA code is commented out and Siena code has been written under it so one can compare JPA to Siena.
Though there are some places where some code was deleted and any new was added sorry I did not make any comments 
so one has to figure everything out on his or her own. It's just a newbie stuff for someone just like me..
Thanks for Play! framework to Play! team and for Siena persitence API for Java to Pascal and his team and everyone 
dabling in the java world :)
